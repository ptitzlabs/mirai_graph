**ARRIVING IN PARIS**

YOUR

ADMINISTRATIVE

SITUATION

```
You are a foreigner and wish to stay in France:
in order to stay on French territory without risking
expulsion, you should apply for a residency permit.
There are various possibilities (asylum claim,
applying for residency permit) depending
on your personal situation.
In the box below you will find information
on how to start an asylum claim.
This is not the only available option.
These procedures are long and complicated.
```
```
For legal help, go to a free legal aid
advice service (see page page 11 )
```
```
For more information, read the
procedure section of this guide
(see page 44 )
```
**ASYLUM CLAIM**

```
Call the OFII to arrange a meeting:
01 42 500 900
```
```
Monday to Friday: 9am-3:30pm
Wait for the language options to choose your
language.There are lots of people calling at
once: The waiting time can be very long.
Every call cuts off automatically after 45
minutes. You have to try several times.
```
```
Careful, this number is not free.
It’s the price of a local call.
If you don’t have a phone, go to a day center
(page 16), the people working there will
lend you one.
If you are unable to get a meeting,
take a screenshot of the calls made
to the OFII from your phone.
This will help you prove that you’ve called
several times and that you haven’t been able
to get a meeting to make an asylum claim.
```
HOUSING

**Emergency**

**accommodation for all**

```
If you don’t have any
accommodation, you can call this
emergency number for free: 115
```
```
You don’t need a French residency permit
to qualify.
```
```
Careful, there aren’t many spaces so
accomodation isn’t guaranteed and is often
only available for a short stay.
```
```
More information on page 33.
```
**Accommodation**

**for asylum seekers**

```
During your first appointment at the Prefecture
(see page 45), the OFII should offer you
housing.
```
```
The waiting time can be very long.
```
```
There are other accommodation solutions,
even before your procedure starts.
```
```
These options are different for men, women,
families and couples (see the following)
```
```
Be careful, the French Office for
immigration and integration (OFII) can offer
you a referral to accommodation in another
region than the one you filed your asylum
claim in. If you refuse to go where you’re
referred, you will not be entitled to
accommodation or financial benefits (ADA)
anymore. More information on page 38.
```
**Single men**

```
If you want to apply for asylum or if you have
started your asylum procedure, you can go
to a day centre (see below) for information
and advice. For those who have applied for an
asylum request at the prefecture, you can apply
for housing at a day centre. Be aware that the
waiting time can be very long. This kind of
housing is only available to registered asylum
seekers who receive ADA financial benefits
and have never been provided with housing
before.

GETTING AROUND

**Tickets**

```
Metro tickets t+ (2,10€) allow you to make a
single trip on the metro or RER (you can take
various metro lines but once you leave the
metro your ticket is no longer valid).
```
- It is cheaper to buy a ticket in the metro
    than on the bus.
- It is cheaper if you buy a pack (carnet)
    of 10 tickets in the metro.

**Pass Navigo**

```
This is a travel pass that you can top-up to
get the bus, metro and RER. It costs 84,10€
a month but some discounts are available:
```
- CSS beneficiaries (ex CMU-C) get a 75% discount
- AME beneficiaries get a 50% discount
- RSA beneficiaries get it for free

```
To get a Navigo Pass
Ask for a Navigo Pass at a RATP office in most
metro stations, at the ticket office. Issuing a
Navigo pass is free and compulsory. If the
RATP agent refuses to issue it, try another
agency.
```
```
To benefit from the “Solidarité
transport” discount
http://www.solidaritetransport.fr/first-request/
online/home
Asylum seekers can get help from the
association that gives them their mail (SPADA).
If you are not entitled to these discounts, you
can buy a ‘Pass Navigo Découverte’ (with daily,
weekly or monthly top-ups) or a ‘Pass Navigo
Liberté’ (linked to your bank card, a journey in
Paris costs 1,49€). You can get more
information at an RATP office.
```
**If there is an inspection**

```
If you travel without a valid ticket, you risk
a fine. If there is an inspection, your identity
papers might be requested. If you don’t have
any ID, the inspectors could ask the police
to come and check your identity. If you are
arrested, see your rights on page 29.
```
```
The inspectors can’t search your belongings
without your consent, but they could ask you
to leave if you refuse.
```
**If you are fined**

```
In the event of a fine, please note the time
limits:
```
- You have a maximum of 3 months from the
    date of the offence to pay your fine. After this
    period, the fine may increase.
- If you pay it within the first 20 days, you will
    get a 20€ discount.
- Please note, if you don’t have a bank card,
    you can only pay with cash for the first
    30 days, in the 5 following offices:

```
Les Halles, Gare de Lyon, La Défense,
Noisy-le-Grand Mont d’Est et Bourg-la-Reine
(see the metro map on page 62).
```
```
The inspectors give you a document called
a fine ticket (PV) or receipt: you should keep
it with you.
```
```
If you have no income, you have three months
from the date of the offence to contest the fine.
Please note that this does not always work.
```
```
If there are any difficulties or you can’t pay
the fine, ask for help from a social worker
(see page 32)
```

EMERGENCY

NUMBERS

YOUR DOCUMENTS

```
It is very important to keep photographs
and copies of all documents and letters in your
name that may be given to you while you’re
staying in France.
Keep these copies in various different places
(at a friend’s place or at an organisation) and
online (in your emails...).
```
```
As soon as you arrive, make sure you keep
track of all of the documents you receive and
organise them by theme (health, work,
education, etc).
```
- They can be **useful for your asylum**
    **procedure or in case of arrest to prove your**
    **presence** on French territory and allow
    organisations to better understand your
    situation.
- These proofs of presence in France will be
    **mandatory if you request a resident permit.**
    Examples: your income declarations (taxes),
    medical prescriptions, social security
    certificate, phone and electricity bills, Pass
    Navigo, proof of domiciliation, pay slips,
    French class registration and diplomas,
    various letters...

**situations :**

- Suspected of violation(crime).
- By the order of prosecutor in specific
    area and limited time.
- In the borders (up to 20km), train

is forbidden to flee the scene until police
arrives. Otherwise the penalty is 2 months of
imprisonment or 7500-euro fine.
```
```

- Remember the place, time, street
    number, name of store, a coffee shop or

- Remember the type of police (national
    police, CRS, PAF, gendarmerie), if
    possible remember the RIO number (
    numbers written on the police officer’s
    chest).

    scream “You hurt me” multiple times so
    the bystanders listen.

    witnesses to film.
- You should not share your telephone
    code.

```
The police does not have the right to:
```
- Refuse being filmed.

- To be violent and to insult.
    - If it’s not possible to prove one’s
       identity, an ADULT can be taken to a

```
During detention if the police is not able to
identify the person, they can take photos and
the finger prints.

    right to make a call.
- At the end of detention, police must
    give the person a detention report.
- If you have received a deportation
    order (OQTF) or a judicial ban from the
    territory :

**1. What does
“unaccompanied minor”**

**mean?**

```
You are an “unaccompanied minor” if:
```
- You are **under 18 years old**
- You are **without parents or without legal**
    **guardians (adults who have legal authority**
    **over you)** in France.
**As an unaccompanied minor, you are
considered to be “in danger”.** You will therefore
be protected and taken into care by Child
Welfare Services: Aide Sociale à l’Enfance (ASE).
**2. Your rights in France**

```
The French State is legally responsible for
unaccompanied minors on its territory and
therefore has to protect them. In charge of
accommodating and protecting these
unaccompanied minors is the Child Welfare
Services (ASE).
Before being taken into care, you will first need
to take an “underage and unaccompanied”
evaluation with the ASE. This evaluation is
mandatory to be taken into care and protected
by the ASE who will interview you to assess if
you truly are underage and unaccompanied.
Usually, this only takes a few days, but it can
take up to a few weeks.
Once you are officially recognized as underage
and unaccompanied, you will be accommodated
and guided towards independence until you
turn 18. That will include socio-educational
work, education or training, legal and
administrative monitoring.
```
**3. Your arrival in Paris**

```
Go to these organizations to help you prepare

**4. The evaluation**

**interview**

```
You will most likely have a quick first
interview, then will be placed in a shelter while
you wait for a second interview. Usually, it is
mandatory for you to be placed in the shelter
before the next interview.
```
```
The second interview will be longer, and you
will have to discuss: your identity, your family,
```
## Unaccompanied minors

### (UNDER 18 WITHOUT A LEGAL GUARDIAN)

```
your life in your home country (living
conditions, education), the reasons why you
left, your journey to France, your living
conditions since you have arrived in France, and
what you plan to do in France.
```
- Do not forget to bring the documents that
    can prove you are underage. **Warning: you**
    **take on a great risk by showing fake identity**
    **papers.**
- **You can ask an organization (see page 11)**
    **to help you retrieve documents from your**
    **home country.**
- **You have the right to an interpreter of your**
    **native language.**
In some cases, after this evaluation, the ASE
can ask for “complementary examinations”:
a verification of your identity papers (if you have
them), and sometimes, a bone age assessment.
**Note that you should not undergo any medical
exams or X-rays if you did not give your
consent and if the judge has not allowed it!
5. After the interview**

```
After the interview, the evaluation center is in
charge of filling out a report for the ASE. Then,
the ASE is in charge of determining whether or
not you are underage based on that report.
You should receive an answer from the
evaluation centre in the following days. Any
rejection must be notified on a document that
indicates the reasons behind that rejection.
There are two possibilities:
```
- **You are officially recognized as an**
    **unaccompanied minor:** you will be
    accommodated (in a shelter, or in an
    apartment, and in some cases in a foster
    home), you will be supported by a tutor, you
    will learn French, go to school or undergo
    professional training in a specific field of work.
- **Or, the ASE does not recognize you as being**
    **underage and/or unaccompanied.
6. In case of rejection**

```
If you are not recognized as a minor, the
reasons behind the rejection should be
explained in a document. It is important for
you to keep that document for the next steps.
You have the right to appeal the decision before
a children’s judge.
The judge will set up a meeting to hear your
case. They can also ask for complementary
examinations: the verification of your papers
and medical exams, with your consent. Once
```
```
they have reviewed your case, the
judge can either recognize you as an
unaccompanied minor or confirm the ASE’s
rejection.
```
- **You have the right to an attorney
- When waiting for the judge’s decision, you**
    **will not be accommodated nor receive**
    **financial aid from the Government.**
For information on where to eat, shower and get
help, see page 14.

because you were scared for your life, or have
been persecuted, you can also apply for asylum
in addition to the procedure for recognition
that you are underage. Because you are
underage, an ad hoc Administrator (a legally
responsible adult) will be appointed to help you
through your application for asylum. This
person is a professional (it can sometimes be
someone who works for an organization such
as France terre d’asile). If a member of your
family is currently in another European Union
country, you can ask to join them.
As a minor, you will not be granted an
allowance for asylum seekers (ADA). Only the
ASE can accommodate unaccompanied minors
because you cannot be accommodated in the
same centers as adults. For more information

**ACCESS TO RIGHTS**

**What are my rights?**

```
In France, people without residency permits–
known as “undocumented migrants” (“sans
papiers”) or “unauthorised” (“situation
irrégulière”) – have rights, including the right to
healthcare (see page 43) and the right to
emergency accommodation (see below).
```
```
People with residency permits, known as
«legal residents» (“en situation régulière”),
have rights that depend on their administrative
status:
```
**- Seeking asylum:** Asylum seekers have rights
related to the procedure. Access to these rights
is subject to certain conditions and stops at the
end of the asylum procedure (for housing and
allowance, see page 36, for work, see page
42)
**- Refugees:** the right to access social benefits
is the same as for French people (benefits and
housing see page 35)
**- Residency permit:** The rights of people who
have a ‘récepissé’ (receipt of application for a
residence permit) or a residence permit issued
by the prefecture depend on the type of
residence permit. For example, not everyone
has the right to work (see page 42).

**Who can help me?**

```
You can ask a social worker to
help you with your procedures.
```
```
Depending on your situation and the problem
you’re facing, these people are different to
those responsible for supporting you in your
administrative and social procedures.
```
```
Social workers often specialise in a specific
area (legal aid, healthcare, employment,
housing) and/or are focused on a certain group
of people (asylum seekers, legal residents
under 25 years old, residents of a certain area
etc.)
```
```
This means it is sometimes necessary to go
to several places to get help on different
issues. The following pages explain where to
get help according to your situation.
```
EMERGENCY

ACCOMMODATION

```
115 If you don’t have any housing,
the main thing you can do is call the emergency
number 115 everyday to ask for temporary
accommodation (from one to several nights
depending on your situation). Accommodation
from 115 is unconditional and free : this means
you don’t need a residency permit to get a place.
```
```
You can call them 24 hours a day but the wait
on the phone can be up to 2 hours or more.
The more you call, the more likely you are
to get a place. We advise you to call very early
in the morning.
```
```
The management of the 115 is split
between the French departments. Your calls
are geo-located, which means that if you call
the Paris line, the 115 will ask you to always call
from Paris in the future so you can be assisted
there. If you call from another department, the
115 in that department will handle your case.
```
```
To apply for longer-term accommodation,
go to your town’s social services or to
an organisation that can make an SIAO
(Service Intégré d’Accueil et d’Orientation)
application for you (list on page 16).
```
**Unaccompanied minors:**

- **If you haven’t been assessed:**
You have a right to unconditional
accommodation “provisional care” for the
duration of your assessment. To get this, go
to an assessment centre (list on page 8).
- **If you have already been assessed:**
Presenting your rejection notice entitles you
to accommodation for adults. You can then
call 115 and state your situation.

IF YOU

ARE ARRESTED

```
If you are a victim of or witness
any police abuse:
Contact the Collective Access
to Law to report any situations
of physical or verbal violence,
expulsions, confiscations
or destruction of property.
https://collectifaccesaudroit.org/202-2/
You may also be referred to lawyers, doctors,
or psychologists.
or contact this number 07 67 29 36 66
(text message and WhatsApp) to send photos
and videos of evacuations and/or police
checks to “l’Observatoire des Libertés
Publiques et la Ligue des droits de l’Homme”.
```
```
You can get arrested during an identity check
```
**-** to confirm whether you have the right to stay
in France – **and/if they suspect you might have
broken the law.**

```
If you do not have papers and you are arrested,
you risk facing an “Obligation to Leave French
Territory” (OQTF) and, in some cases, a house
arrest or being locked up in an Immigration
Detention Center: Centre de Rétention
Administrative (CRA).
```
**Documents**

**and information**

**that you must always**

**have on you:**

- The documents regarding your **procedure**
    (proof of your asylum application “récépissé”,
    your request for a resident permit...)
- Proof of **“domiciliation”, residency or**
    **accommodation**
- Proof of **health insurance,** if you have it
    (PUMA, CSS, AME), any documents linked to
    your health coverage and the contact details
    of your doctor.

**Juil-Août 2024**


- Any document regarding **your family**
    **situation in France** (ex: your child’s
    school registration certificate, marriage
    certificate...)
- A **phone card and/or a phone without
a camera.**
- The phone number of **someone you trust** :
a friend, a member of an organisation
or a lawyer to be notified **IMMEDIATELY**
if you are arrested or detained.

```
Keep copies of your documents in different
places (a friend’s house, the offices of
an organization) and online (email, etc...).
```
```
Never give anyone your passport (even if
it’s expired) because that can lead to your
deportation. However, the absence of a
passport can be used as an argument to place
you in an Immigration Detention Center.
```
**Your rights**

**in a police station**

```
You can be detained for a maximum of 24h
for an identity check / a maximum of 48h
if they suspect you have broken the law.
```
```
You have 4 basic rights.
You can ask:
```
- For an **interpreter of your native language.**
    Make sure to ask for the dialect you speak
    best, even if it is less common: Arabic,
    Sudanese, Kurdish Sorani, Senegalese Fulani...
- To see a **doctor**
- To see a **lawyer**
- To **phone a friend or an organisation you**
    **trust.** Give them the details of your arrest
    (where, when) in order for them to help you.

```
Do NOT sign any documents you don’t
understand. Ask for an interpreter!
```
**If you’re released**

```
If your situation is irregular, at your release,
you might be issued an order to be deported
(Obligation to Leave French Territory – OQTF)
and sometimes you can be barred from coming
back on French territory (interdiction de retour
sur le territoire Français – IRTF). This order
sometimes comes with a house arrest.
```
```
Note that, in most cases, you only have 48
hours from the time you signed the paper to
appeal the decision.
```
```
As soon as you are released, contact a lawyer
or an organization to seek help (page 11).
```
```
If you have been insulted or mistreated
by the police, you can file a complaint.
The police cannot prevent you from filing
a complaint, even if you do not have papers.
If you have been physically assaulted, you
can see a doctor to get a medical certificate
that proves your injuries (page 11).
```
**If you have been**

**transferred to an**

**Immigration Detention**

**Centre (CRA)**

```
The objective of the Immigration Detention
Center (CRA), where you will be locked up, is
to send you back to your home country, to the
country responsible for your asylum application
(Dublin procedure), or to the country that
granted you protection (remise Schengen).
```
```
As soon as you arrive at the CRA, immediately
ask to see the organization that is working
there: ASSFAM-Groupe SOS, Forum Réfugiés,
France Terre d’Asile, La Cimade).
```
```
Those organizations will help you file your
appeal and will give you information on the
various steps you need to take while you are
being detained.
```
```
If there are no organizations present (Sundays,
public holidays, etc.), contact an outside
organization (page 11).
```
```
How long can you be detained
for?
The maximum length for your detention is
90 days, during which you can file two
appeals for your release:
```
1. **Appealing against your detention.**
The Judge of Liberties and Detention (JLD)
has 48 hours to decide whether or not to
extend your detention.
2. **Appealing against the deportation
decision.**
The Administrative Court will be asked to
revoke the deportation decision (only if that
decision is recent, less than 48 hours).

```
Depending on the judge’s decision, you may
be released, or your detention could be
extended.
```
```
For someone to be deported, the French State
must be in possession of the individual’s valid
passport or a “consular pass”.
```
- **If you didn’t provide your passport** during
    the identity check and you refuse to see the
    consular authorities from your country, it will
    be more difficult for the French State to issue
    you a “laisser-passer” (transfer pass): this will
    only complicate your deportation.
       Careful: if you refuse to meet with the
    consular authorities, you can receive a short
    prison sentence (1 to 4 months).
- **If you falsified your identity:** the police will
    not be able to know what country you are
    from. This also complicates your deportation.
       Note that, if the police realizes you
    falsified your identity, you can receive a short
    prison sentence (1 month to 3 years).

```
If you get sentenced to prison time,
at the end of your time, you risk being locked
up at the CRA again.
```
```
The maximum 90-day detention will start over.
```
**Your rights in**

**a detention centre**

- **You can make calls** from the CRA’s public
    phones or with your own mobile phone that
    is without a camera. Mobile phones with
    cameras will be confiscated.
- **Your friends, relatives and organization**
    **members have the right to visit you.**
    They are allowed to bring you clothes,
    non-perishable goods (ex: biscuits, sodas),
    documents and money.

```
If a friend or relative is in a detention centre
(CRA), you can contact the organization on-site.

ASYLUM

SEEKER BENEFITS

(CMA)

**What are the CMA**

**benefits (Conditions**

**Matérielles d’Accueil)?**

```
As an asylum seeker, when you go through
the «single central reception desk»
(GUDA - see page 42), the OFII should offer
you aid including:
```
- **a monthly allowance (ADA)**
- **the right to accommodation for asylum**
    **seekers (see page 33)**

```
This aid is called «offer of care» in accordance
with the national reception plan (In French:
«l’offre de prise en charge au titre du dispositif
national d’accueil»).
```
```
To benefit from it, you need to sign the form
given to you by the OFII at the GUDA, agreeing
to the material reception conditions
(«Conditions matérielles d’accueil» or CMA).
```
```
Careful: It’s a “package” deal: You can
either benefit from housing AND financial
allowance, or have neither.
```
```
The OFII can refuse or cancel your right to
material conditions of reception for various
reasons (more information on page 36)
```
```
For example:
```
- If you **refuse to go to the accommodation
offered by the OFII,**
- If you **move out of your accommodation,**
- If you **don’t go to your Prefecture
appointments** especially when you are in the
Dublin procedure (see page 49)

**Financial benefits (ADA)**

```
The ADA card is a payment card where you can
receive an allowance every month. You can’t
use it for online payments. Some shops may
offer cash back services.
```
```
You should receive your ADA allowance at the
beginning of each month while your asylum
claim is being processed. The amount of your
allowance (about 7€ a day) will depend on your
personal situation (couple, family, alone...) and
whether you have accommodation or not.
```
```
Once you’ve received the card, you have
to wait 30 to 45 days until it’s activated.
```
```
The Upcohesia app allows you to check how
much money you have left on your ADA card.
Download it on your phone from Google Play
or the Apple App Store.
```
```
What should I do if my card
is blocked, stolen or lost?
```
**1. Stolen or lost card:**
call the this number to block your card so it
can’t be used anymore:

```
05 32 09 10 10
```
**2. Stolen, lost or blocked card:** Make an
appointment at your region’s OFII to replace
your card (call or email them).

```
If you have any problems, seek help from a
social worker at the association that houses you
or delivers your mail or from a legal advice
centre (see page 11).
```
```
I’m not receiving money
from the OFII
```
```
See the following page (page 36) for more
information.
```
**Asylum seekers**

**Accommodation**

```
As an asylum seeker - and if you agreed to the
material reception conditions (ADA) offered by
the OFII at the “single central reception desk”
```
- you should have a space in a housing centre
for asylum seekers (CADA, HUDA, etc.) or you
can receive social support.

```
You cannot choose the region nor the town
that you’ll be placed in. If you asked for asylum
in Paris or Ile-de-France, then it is very probable
you will be sent to another region in France.
```
```
If you refuse the OFII’s offer of
accommodation, you will lose your right to
accommodation and to the ADA allowance.
```
```
Note that in France, not every asylum seeker
will benefit from accommodation because
of a lack of housing. To get help: go to the
organisation where you receive your mail
(SPADA).
```
```
If you are seeking asylum in Paris and
you have never benefited from any
accommodation, go to a specialised
DAY CENTRE to get registered on the waiting
list for an accommodation application
(see page 16)
```
**Single men**

```
ACCUEIL DE JOUR CITÉ
1 boulevard du Palais, 75004 Paris
Cité
ACCUEIL DE JOUR AUSTERLITZ
24 Quai d’Austerlitz, 75013 Paris
Quai de la gare, Gare de Lyon
For more information on these day centres for
single men seeking asylum (such as opening
hours and how they operate), see page 16.
```
**Appealing against**

**the refusal or**

**withdrawal of CMA**

```
You may be refused your rights
to “conditions matérielles
d’accueil” (CMA: financial
and accommodation benefits):
```
- **If your asylum application is under**
    **reexamination,**
- **If you do not have a valid reason for not**
    **applying for asylum within 90 days of your**
    **arrival in France,**
- **In case of fraud, if you gave false information**
    **or you concealed information,**
- **If you refuse the accommodation or do not**
    **move to the region to which the OFII has**
    **sent you.**

```
Your CMA rights may also be
suspended:
```
- If you **refuse or move out of the**
    **accommodation or the region to which the**
    **OFII sent you,**
- If you are violent or **seriously disrespect your**
    **accommodation rules,**
- If you **don’t respect the authorities’**
    **requirements** (if you refuse to provide
    information, don’t show up to interviews...)

```
The OFII should give you a document
explaining why your rights to CMA
were refused or withdrawn:
don’t hesitate to ask for it in case
they don’t give it to you. This document
may be very useful in an appeal against
the decision.

Juil-Août 2024


**Asking for the CMA**

**to be reinstated**

```
If you receive a document from the OFII
indicating an intention to refuse or suspend
your CMA, you have 15 days to send a letter
that states your identity and that gives reasons
for contesting the decision.
```
```
Send the letter to the OFII headquarters:
```
```
44 rue Bargue
75732 Paris Cedex 15
```
```
If the OFII doesn’t change its decision,
that letter will be very useful for your lawyer
during the administrative appeal.
```
```
If the decision to suspend your CMA
is maintained, you can:
```
**1. Send an informal appeal (“recours
gracieux”)** against the suspension of your
CMA to the OFII Director within two months
    contentieux.cma@ofii.fr
**2. Appeal against the decision to suspend
your CMA in front of an administrative court**
within two months.

```
If your CMA were suspended or denied over
two months ago, you can always ask the OFII
to reinstate your CMA by sending a registered
letter (“lettre recommandée”) to the postal
address above, or an email:
contentieux.cma@ofii.fr
```
- **If you receive a negative answer,** you
    have two months to appeal in front of an
    administrative court to contest the decision.
- **If the OFII has not given you an answer after**
    **2 months,** you have two months to appeal
    in front of an administrative court.

```
It is necessary to justify any specific
vulnerable situation to get a positive answer.
```
```
You can also go through this procedure if you
have not received the letter indicating that your
CMA are being suspended.
```
```
Careful, it can be difficult to write these
documents alone and the time frame for
appeals can vary depending on your situation.
It is therefore strongly suggested to go to
a legal assistance office to get help from
a lawyer (see page 11).
```
**Special cases**

```
It is possible to ask for the reinstatement of
your CMA or to contest the decision for the
refusal of your CMA in the following situations:
```
- **For people “re-qualified”, meaning for those**
    **who went through a normal or a fast-tracked**
    **procedure after the time frame on their**
    **Dublin transfer expired:**
    to ask for the reinstatement of your CMA,
    follow the same procedure as the one
    indicated above.
- **For people coming back to France after**
    **a Dublin transfer:**
    it is possible to immediately appeal against
    the refusal of your CMA by the OFII in front
    of an administrative court.

```
Careful, you must be able to prove you
are in a vulnerable situation, which means
explaining why being without financial and
accommodation benefits puts you in danger.
For example: a medical certificate proving
a serious illness.
```
HOUSING

### ACCOMODATION ( HÉBERGEMENT )

```
is a temporary service (see emergency
accommodation on page 29 and accommodation
for asylum seekers on page 33).
```
```
Whereas, HOUSING ( LOGEMENT ) is stable
and long-term. It is only available to legal
residents in France (‘en situation régulière’),
who have been granted asylum (refugee
status or subsidiary protection) or who have
a residency permit. A fee is charged.
```
**How do I apply?**

```
To apply for accommodation or long-term
housing (known as a “demande SIAO”) , you
must get help from a social worker in your
current accommodation, from the city’s social
services or from an organisation (see page 11).
You should update your application regularly,
especially if your situation changes.
```
```
Please note that delays can be very long.
```
**Social housing**

```
If you are a legal resident (en situation
régulière) and you have the resources
(including minimum social benefits such as
RSA), you can apply for social housing.
```
```
To do so, you must fill in an online form here:
http://www.demande-logement-social.gouv.fr
```
```
You can fill it out for yourself and on behalf
of your family (spouse, partner and children
as well as grandparents, parents, grandchildren,
or brothers and sisters) if they are legal residents.
```
```
You can get help from a social worker.
```
```
Depending on your situation, you can also take
other steps:
```
**Other steps**

```
DAHO: The right to adequate accommodation
(‘le Droit à l’Hébergement Opposable’) allows
you to make an appeal when you call the 115
for a long time without an answer or
accommodation.
```
```
DALO: The right to adequate housing (‘le Droit
au Logement Opposable’) allows you to make
an appeal when you are poorly housed (lack of
housing, threat of eviction without re-housing,
over-occupied housing, abnormally long wait
for housing, etc.). If you have been granted
asylum, you can make a DALO claim 6 months
after applying for social housing.

Action Logement: This is only possible if you
work for a company with more than 10
employees. Ask your employer for more

FINANCIAL

SUPPORT

```
What is an allowance?
An ALLOWANCE , also known as benefits, is a
sum of money paid by the state under certain
conditions. The amount changes depending
on your administrative status, age, the
composition of your family, your housing etc.
```
```
For asylum seekers: see the ADA on page 32.
```
**The Active Solidarity**

**Income “Le Revenu de**

**Solidarité Active” (RSA)**

```
You can apply for this from the family benefits

DOMICILIATION

```
What is a “domiciliation”?
DOMICILIATION is a postal address where
you can receive your mail from the French
administration. It is therefore an essential
step to benefit from your social rights.
Your domiciliation address could be different
to your accommodation address.
```
**For asylum seekers**

```
Your region’s SPADA is responsible for helping
you with your social and administrative
procedures. They should also give you a
domiciliation at the request of the OFII. When
you visit the “single central reception desk”
(GUDA), they will give you an appointment to
get your domiciliation address. This option is
only available to asylum seekers.
```
```
Please note that only a domiciliation
approved by the prefecture is accepted to
renew the asylum application certificate,
i.e. a domiciliation:
```
- In the SPADA
- In your accomodation/hostel
- Or your own home address, only if you or
    a close relative (parents, brother or sister)
    is a tenant. A certificate of accommodation
    from a friend will not be accepted.

```
If you don’t or no longer have an address,
go to your department’s OFII and ask to be
directed to the relevant SPADA.
```
```
Even if you are going through the Dublin
procedure and the prefecture labels you
“on the run”, the SPADA must keep your
domiciliation.
```
**For refugees**

```
People who are granted international protection
(refugee status, subsidiary protection or
stateless status) have the right to remain
domiciled and supported at the SPADA
for 6 months after receiving a decision.
```
```
However, you will be asked to find another
domiciliation address quickly before your
domiciliation at the SPADA is closed (page 23)
```
- Either the person housing you agrees to
    provide you with approriate proof of housing
    (signed, dated proof of housing, a copy or
    their ID card or residency permit and
    supporting housing documents);
- Or you can prove a link with a municipality
    and go to its CCAS (see ‘For other situations’);
- Or if you can’t prove a link with a municipality
    or its CCAS refused you, you can go to an
    organisation recognised by the prefecture.
    (A list of authorised organisations in Ile de
    France is available here: [http://bitly.ws/IqCn).](http://bitly.ws/IqCn).)

**For other situations**

```
A domiciliation address is always essential
to carry out certain administrative procedures,
in particular, regularisation procedures.
Some even offer social support.
```
```
If you aren’t an asylum seeker, administrative
domiciliation will be garunteed by the
organisation that houses you , or, failing this,
a CCAS or an authroised association. In effect,
if you can prove a link to a municipality, you can
request a domiciliation from the Community Social
Action Centre (CCAS) in the town you live in.
```
```
Whether you’re in a legal situation or not,
the link with the municipality is established if:
```
- Your child goes to school in a municipality
- You work in a municipality
- Your close family lives in the municipality
- You have social or medical support or if you
    are benefitting from a professional integration
    programme
- You have undertaken procedures
    with institutional or assoiative structures
    in the municipality

```
There isn’t a CCAS in Paris so you have to make
an appointment at Paris Adresse (see page 23)
to get a domiciliation. You will then be entitled
to a follow-up appointment at a social work
centre (Permanence social d’accueil, PSA).
```
SCHOOL

ENROLLMENT

FOR CHILDREN

**From school**

**to high school**

```
In France, all children under 16 have the right
to go to school. Whatever your status or your
parent’s status of residence in France, school is
free : all children have access to school and are
obliged to go.
```
```
You need to contact the city hall (“mairie”)
closest to where you live. If you encounter
difficulties, you should contact a legal aid
service (see page 11).
```
GOING BACK

TO UNIVERSITY

```
Whatever your situation is (without papers/
documentation, asylum seeker, refugee
or beneficiary of subsidiary protection),
you have the right to study/resume your
studies in France. It is important to know
that the university is not supposed to check
if you have a residence permit.
```
**To qualify to apply you must:**

**1.** have your baccalaureate
**2.** have a sufficient level of French (B2 for
a bachelor and C1 for a master). Registration
details (and chances of acceptance) depend on

```
the university, the type of training/
education, your status and the level of
entry you are applying for (L1, L2, master...).
```
```
You must pay attention to the calendar;
certain procedures are required as of
November to start classes the following
September.
```
```
French classes are offered in certain
universities to prepare for your studies.
```
```
Students who have a refugee status or
are beneficiaries of subsidiary protection have
access to scholarships based on social criteria
and access to university residences managed
by CROUS.

EMPLOYMENT

**For asylum seekers**

```
As an asylum seeker, from the 1st of March
2019, you will only be allowed to start working
6 months after having started your asylum
procedure, and only if you haven’t yet
received an answer from the OFPRA.
```
```
If you get an offer of employment when your
asylum application attestation (‘récépissé’) is
still valid, your future employer must submit
the application to the competent Directorate.
```
```
Otherwise, when you apply to renew your
expired certificate, you must apply for a work
permit at the prefecture.
```
```
You will need to give them a valid 3-month long
or longer work contract established on a special
form, or an offer of employment (stating your
function, the day you start working and your
name) as well as other documents concerning
the company.
```
```
Be aware that you cannot change employers
because that work permit is only valid for
the job offer submitted to the prefecture.
```
```
This authorization will only be valid as long as
your asylum application attestation (‘récépissé’)
is valid. This work permit can be renewed any
time during the period you are waiting for the
decision from the OFPRA.
```
**For refugees**

```
Once you have been granted refugee status
or subsidiary protection, you are allowed to
legally work in France, with no conditions.
```
```
Contact organisations to get help in your search
for employment.
```
**For young people**

```
Youth service centers called “missions locales”
provide one-to-one support to youth aged
16-25, to help with social integration and
finding employment:
http://www.mission-locale.fr/annuaire/agence/
mission-locale-de-paris
```
```
You can also complete a 6-12 month long civic
service (service civique) in a general interest
field, earning 580€ to 690€ each month,
until the eve of your 26th birthday.
http://www.service-civique.gouv.fr
```
OPENING

A BANK ACCOUNT

```
You can open a “livret A” account at the Postal
Bank (La Banque Postale). The Livret A is a
savings account in which you can deposit and
withdraw cash money, and make bank
transfers.
```
```
You will be given a bank identity statement
(RIB): this document may be useful for certain
administrative procedures.
```
```
Everyone has the right to open a bank account.
If you are an asylum seeker, the SPADA or the
association of your accommodation centre
can help you organize a meeting with the bank.
```
```
If you have any questions, you can go to an
association for help: see page 11
```
**To open a Livret A, you need:**

- to be **over 18 years old,**
- an **identity document** (asylum seeker
    attestation (récépissé), passport...),
- a **domiciliation** attestation,
- 2€: the minimum opening deposit.

```
You can only withdraw cash with la Banque
Postale cash withdrawal machines.
```
ACCESS

TO HEALTHCARE

**Emergency care**

```
While waiting to be granted the health
protection best suited to your situation, you
can use the Free Medical Access Points
(Permanences d’Accès aux Soins de Santé
-PASS) found in certain hospitals (see page 18).
You will be taken care of by doctors and have
access to free medication.
```
```
You can also get consultations and advice from
medical organisations (see page 18).
```
**Universal Health**

**protection (PUMA -**

**Formerly called CMU)**

```
For people with legal residence papers
```
```
If you are an asylum seeker who has been in
France for 3 or more months, you can benefit
from health insurance through Universal
Health Protection (PUMA) and complementary
Health Coverage (CSS) by presenting the asylum
application that is given to you at the single
central reception desk (GUDA). This will allow
you to access free healthcare and
hospitalisation for you, your spouse and your
children. You may have to pay medical fees
upfront and be reimbursed after.
```
```
You can ask for help from the institution
housing you, or the institution in charge of
accompanying you throughout the review of
your asylum application (SPADA). You can also
ask for help from organisations (see page 11) or
from hospital social services at a hospital that’s
already treated you.
```
**State Medical**

**Aid : “Aide Médicale**

**d’État” (AME)**

```
For people without legal residence papers
```
```
The AME covers 100% of any medical care
for which it has given approval.
```
```
Conditions to meet in order
to get the AME:
```
- **Having no legal residency papers** nor any
    documents as proof of resident status
    (no valid residency permit, asylum application
    receipt, nor documents showing that you
    are in the process of applying for a valid
    residency permit) **OR**
- **Having lived in France for at least 3**
    **uninterrupted months** without residence
    permit
- **Having a limited source of income** that
    doesn’t go over a given threshold.

```
The application needs to be deposited to the
Caisse Primaire d’Assurance Maladie (CPAM)
of your place of residence. You can get help
in assembling the file from one of these
institutions:
```
- **Communal social action centres (CCAS)**
    of your place of residence
- **Day centres** (page 16)
- **Hospital social service** (page 18)
- **Organisations** (page 11 )

```
The CPAM should inform you of its decision
within 2 months at the latest; if the application
is accepted, you can obtain your AME card
which is valid for 1 year, starting from the
beginning of the application procedure.
```
```
Note that: renewal is not automatic and you
must fill out and submit a new file 2 months
before the expiry date written on the AME
card.

**PROCEDURES**

```
You are a foreigner and wish to stay in France: in order to stay on French territory without risking
expulsion, you should apply for a residency permit. You have various possibilities (asylum claim,
applying for a residency permit) which depend on your personal situation.
```
```
The information in this guide will help you understand the steps to follow. It will however never
replace the help from a specialised lawyer who will be able to examine your personal situation.
What may have worked for someone you know will not necessarily work for you.
```
```
See page 11 to find social and legal help.
```
ASYLUM,

WHAT IS THAT?

```
Seeking asylum means you are asking for a
country’s protection because you are in danger
as you have been persecuted and threatened in
your country of origin due to your religion,
nationality, political opinion, race or social
group.
```
```
The asylum procedure determines whether
you are eligible to become a refugee.
```
```
Refugee status and subsidiary protection
enable you to be protected by the French state:
```
- You are **allowed to live on French territory**
    **(residency permit)**
- You can acquire French documents **to work**
    **legally**
- You can ask **to have your family come over**
    **to join you** (family reunification).

```
If you have not been persecuted in your home
country, it will be difficult to get asylum in
France.
```
```
See page 11 to find social and legal help from a
specialised organisation.
```
```
For more information about the different steps
of the procedure, see page 48.
```
RESIDENCE

PERMITS

```
There are different types of residency permits
according to your situation:
```
- **The healthcare residency permit** is for sick
    foreigners who cannot be treated in their
    countries of origin.
- **The employment residency permit** is for
    people who have been working in France for
    several years and who wish to regularise their
    situation, student residence permit for
    foreigners who wish to study in France...
- **The student residency permits** is for
    foreigners who wish to study in France.

```
Applying for a residency permit is a
complicated procedure. It is therefore very
important to seek advice from a lawyer before
you start your application.
```
```
You should go to a specialised legal organisation
that will help you evaluate your personal
situation and fill in your application
(see page 11).
```
```
More information on page 62.
```
```
-18
```
**Unaccompanied**

**minors**

```
Go to the evaluation services (see page 8)
to be recognized as an unaccompanied
minor. This will grant you the protection
of the Child Social Services (Aide Sociale
à l’Enfance) which will give you access to
housing, education and healthcare until you
turn 18.
```
```
You can still ask for asylum and make an
appointment at the SPADA.
```
```
However, if you wish to ask for asylum, you
must go through a specific procedure, so be
sure to ask help from specialist organisation
(see page11)
```
FIRST RECEPTION

```
As soon as you arrive in France you must go to
a SPADA reception centre to start your asylum
application.
```
```
In Paris and Île-de-France, you have to call this
number to make an appointment at the SPADA:
```
```
01 42 500 900
```
```
You can call from Monday to Friday from 10am
to 4:30pm. This number is not free!
```
```
If no one answers when you call, keep a record
of your call history in your phone so you can
prove you tried making an appointment several
times.
```
```
When you call, wait for the language options
so you can choose yours.
```
```
There is a SPADA in every region (Paris, Bobigny,
Nanterre...).
```
```
Even if you call in Paris, you may receive an
appointment somewhere other than Paris.
At the end of your call, you will receive a
confirmation text message with the date, time
and address of the SPADA appointment.
```
```
Families: go to the SPADA with EVERY
MEMBER OF THE FAMILY, including those who
have already been granted asylum in France.
```
**SPADA**

**appointment:**

**1. During the appointment an officer will give
you information about asylum in France and
ask for information about yourself. You will
have to give:**
- **Personal information (name, age...)**
- **Your date of departure from your country**
    **and date of arrival in France.** Careful: if you
    say you entered France more than 90 days
    ago, your file will be processed with the
    Fast-Track Procedure, which is not ideal.
- **The route you took** to get to France.
- **The language you wish to use** during the
    entire asylum process
**2. They will ask you to fill in your information
on the computer in their office.** This
information will be shared with the prefecture
(French administration centre). Any false
information might lead to your file being
processed using the unfavourable Fast-Track
Procedure. (see page 48)
**3. They will give you a «convocation» letter to
go to the «single central reception desk»
(GUDA).** At this single central reception desk,
you will be able to register your asylum
application.

THE ASYLUM

APPLICATION

```
All the information you need will be indicated
on your convocation letter inviting you to your
obligatory appointment at the GUDA (Guichet
Unique pour Demandeurs d’Asile - Single
counter for asylum seekers). You will have the
address, date and time of your appointment.
```
```
Be there on time! If you arrive late to your
appointment, you will not be accepted.
```
```
Be aware that you might spend half a day
to a whole day there.
```
**At the GUDA, you will find:**

**1. The Prefecture counter** to register your
asylum claim
**2. The OFII counter** which will evaluate your
vulnerability during an interview
(accommodation and medical state)

```
DO NOT LOSE THE DOCUMENTS
given to you by the prefecture and
the Ofii. Take photos, photocopy them
and be sure to keep copies (paper and
digital) in different places.
```
```
The asylum procedure is for people who are in
danger in their home countries.
It is possible to ask for a residency permit for
another reason (health issues, family ties...)
```
```
If you wish to start your residency permit
procedure at the same time as your asylum
claim, you have 2 months from your visit to the
single central reception desk (GUDA) to do so.
Once that delay has passed the prefecture
could refuse to register your resident permit
claim.
```
```
Go to a specialized organisation for more
information (see page 11)
```
**What to do when you**

**arrive at the «single**

**central reception desk»**

**(GUDA)?**

**1. Go to the prefecture counter
to register your asylum claim**

```
An officer in charge of registering your asylum
claim will:
```
- Take your **fingerprints** ,
- **Check whether you have already applied**
    **for asylum** in France or in another country
    of the European Union
- Give you a booklet to guide you through
    the procedure in your native language,
- Ask you to **choose the language** you want
    to speak throughout the whole procedure.
    Once you have chosen your language, it will
    be difficult to ask for another one during the
    procedure. You can however switch to French
    at anytime
- Give you **proof of your asylum application**
    **(a récépissé)** stating which procedure you will
    be going through: normal procedure, fast-track
    procedure or Dublin procedure page 48)
- Give you an **OFPRA file.** It is very important
    to fill it out properly. Carefully read the
    information on page 50 and ask a specialist
    organisation for help (see page 11)
- Give you an username and a password to
    access **your OFPRA personal space online:**
    https://bit.ly/3PUapM0

```
Starting May 2022, the distribution of OFPRA
documents is digitalised for new asylum
seekers. It means that the OFPRA will give you
the reception notice of your file, your
appointment date and the answer to your
asylum request through your online personal
space: https://www.usager.ofpra.gouv.fr/ofpra/
user/login
```
```
You can apply for a dispensation from
the digitalisation of the OFPRA notifications,
especially for people without housing
(who do not have access to a computer).
```
```
Careful: the opening of your mail on your
online personal space marks the beginning
of the appeal timeframe.
```
```
Find help and access to a computer at the SPADA
for the first access to your online personal space.
```
**2. Go to the OFII’s counter**

```
What is OFII?
Office Français d’Immigration et d’Intégration
(French Office for Immigration and
Integration.) The OFII is responsible for the
reception of asylum seekers in France and for
accompanying them throughout their asylum
application procedure (providing financial aid
and accommodation)
```
```
An OfII officer will:
```
- **Ask you about your personal situation to see**
    **if you have specific needs.** (for example if
    you’re disabled, pregnant, if you need to see
    a psychologist...)
- **Give you a form called “Offer of support**
    **from the national reception centre”** (In
    French “Offre de prise en charge au titre du
    dispositif national d’accueil”) offering aid
    from the OFII. This will allow you to get
    accommodation and financial benefits (ADA).
    To get this help offered by the OfII, sign the
    form by ticking the box that says «Oui,
    j’accepte de bénéficier des conditions
    matérielles d’accueil» (Yes, I agree to accept
    the material reception conditions)

```
You cannot benefit from the financial
allowance (ADA) without agreeing to the
accommodation offer. It’s a package deal:
you can either benefit from housing and
financial benefits, or you get nothing.
```
```
The OFII can send you to an accommodation/
shelter in a region that is different to the one
where you applied for asylum. The OfII will
provide you with a transportation ticket and
the SPADA or accommodation address that you
have to go to within 5 days. You will have to
remain in this area throughout the whole
asylum procedure.
```
```
You won’t have access to accommodation or
financial benefits (ADA) if you refuse to go.
However, the OFII should direct youto a SPADA
in Île-de-France.
```
```
If you accept the regional allocation but
don’t go there , you must warn the OFII.
You won’t have the right to access housing or
financial benefits (ADA). An organisation can
help you ask to transfer your domiciliation in
Île-de-France (page 11).
```
```
Be careful, if you agree to go to another region
but you return to Île-de-Drance even after a
few days, you will lose housing and financial
benefits as well as a domiciliation in a SPADA in
Île-de-France. An organsation will be able to
help you better understand the situation and
renew your asylum claim (see page 11).
```
**3. Getting a registered postal
address (domiciliation) at a SPADA**

```
After your appointment with the «single central
reception desk» (GUDA), you will have to return
to the SPADA to get a registered postal address
(in French this is called a «domiciliation»).
```
```
This step is mandatory to take advantage of the
«conditions matérielles d’accueil” or CMA and
submit your OFPRA application.
```
```
Careful, your “domiciliation” must be in the
same region as the prefecture handling your
asylum application.
```
```
If the OfII has already directed you to another
region, your “domiciliation” will definitely be
transferred to that region, even if you refuse to
be accommodated there.
```
```
What is «domiciliation»?
In order to carry out all their administrative
procedures, asylum seekers need a registered
mailing address.
This allows the person to receive letters from
French administration offices like OFPRA or
CNDA and to access their rights.
Domiciliation is only valid while the asylum
process is underway.
```
```
The SPADA is the organization that set up your
GUDA appointment. When this organisation
gives you a registered postal address, you will
start to benefit from their social and legal
support: access to health insurance,
emergency housing, reduced cost for
transportation, asylum application support...

THE ASYLUM

PROCEDURES

**Normal procedure**

```
Your asylum application will be examined in the
normal way by the OFPRA (Office Français de
Protection des Réfugiés et Apatrides - French
Office for the Protection of Asylum Seekers
and Stateless People).
```
```
You are entitled to specific social rights for
asylum seekers (social security), financial and
housing assistance (depending on your
agreement with the OFII’s benefit form)
```
```
You have 21 days to fill in the OFPRA form
that you were given at the GUDA and to go to
the post office to send it to the OFPRA with all
of the requested documents.
```
```
If your file is complete, the OFPRA will send you
a confirmation letter. This letter enables you to
renew your asylum application attestation
(récépissé) for another 9 months.
```
```
Renewing your asylum application
attestation (récépissé) can take a few days,
so be sure to go to the prefecture a few days
before the expiry date with a recent proof of
domiciliation.
```
```
If your attestation of asylum application is
expired, you run the risk of getting arrested
during an identity check (see page 29)
```
**Fast-track procedure**

**This procedure is not ideal:**

```
The time they take to examine your file will be
shorter and you may not be able to benefit
from material help (financial support and
housing).
```
```
You should ask the Prefecture to give you a
document explaining why your application was
sent to a fast-track procedure.
```
```
This document must be put in your OFPRA file,
as it is essential to your application. Follow
the advice given for the normal procedure
to renew your asylum application attestation
(the récépissé).
```
```
Possible reasons why you have been placed
on a Fast-Track Procedure:
```
- If you **refuse to have your fingerprints taken**
    or if they cannot be read,
- If you **hid or gave false information** about
    yourself or your journey,
- If you **have received an order to leave French**
    **territory (OQTF),**
- If you **have already applied for asylum** or are
    applying for reconsideration (page 54),
- If you **sent your application more than**
    **90 days after your arrival in France** and you
    can’t jusify why. This is considered a sign that
    you don’t have urgent need of your application
    being accepted.
- If **you come from a country that is considered**
    **safe:** Albania, Armenia, Bosnia-Herzegovina,
    Cape Verde, Georgia, India, Kosovo, Macedonia,
    Moldova, Mongolia, Montenegro, Serbia.

```
If you think that your application should be
assessed using the normal procedure, you can
tell the OFPRA (in your story (récit) or during
the interview) why you disagree.
```
```
The OFPRA can put you in normal procedure.
If the OFPRA doesn’t move you, you can take
your arguments to the CNDA. You can also
make this request if you come from Benin,
Ghana or Senegal and registered your asylum
claim before July 2021.
```
**Dublin procedure**

```
If the Prefecture decides to process your
file in the Dublin Procedure, it may mean that
your fingerprints were found in another
European country where you already sought
asylum, or that you obtained a visa in another
European country. That country is responsible
for your asylum application.
```
```
The Prefecture will therefore ask that country
to take you back in order to examine your
application there.
```
```
While you wait for the country’s answer, you
are allowed to stay in France and should be
granted access to asylum seekers’ assistance
such as the asylum seekers’ financial help (ADA)
and social health insurance (PUMA). The
Prefecture will arrange various appointments
that you must attend if you wish to continue to
be eligible for housing and financial aid.
```
```
Careful: you will be given a transfer
order during one of these appointments at the
Prefecture. From this point onwards, you risk
being sent to a detention centre and
transferred to the country in charge of the
asylum application. The French state has 6
months after the date that the country agreed
to take you back to transfer you there.
```
```
It is possible to appeal and request
that France be responsible for your
asylum application and not to be transferred.
(Time of appeals: 48 hours if you are under
house arrest, otherwise 15 days). Your chances
of winning the appeal depend on your personal
situation (health, family, countries through
which you have travelled...) but they are
generally slim.
```
```
If you lose the appeal, you will have to wait
6 extra months to be able to apply for
asylum in France, during which you still risk
being transferred.
```
```
Go to a specialist legal organisation as
soon as possible to get help and advice if
you want to appeal.
```
```
If you haven’t been transferred to the
country in charge of your asylum application
within the transfer period ( 6 months or more
depending on your situation), France should be
in charge of your application if all goes well.
```
```
Careful, every Dublin procedure is different,
what may have worked for one person might
not work for you.
```
```
If you have been transferred but
have returned to France, you must re-register
your asylum application at the prefecture.
```
```
If you didn’t show up to your
Prefecture appointments or if you refuse to be
transferred, you risk being considered «on the
run». In that case you will no longer be entitled
to your asylum seekers rights (housing and ADA
financial aid). Transfer delays will be extended
to 18 months. At the end of that period, France
will become responsible for your asylum
application.
```
```
Careful: It is very complicated to calculate
these delays. Ask a lawyer for advice.
```
```
Whatever happens, go to a Free Legal
Aid office with all your documents as soon as
possible to get more information about your
specific situation in the Dublin Procedure
(see page 11).

OFPRA FILE AND

INTERVIEW

```
What is OFPRA?
```
```
L’Office Français de Protection des Réfugiés
et Apatrides (French Office for the Protection
of Refugees and Stateless People).
It is a public institution responsible for
reviewing the asylum applications and taking
their decision to grant (or not) International
protection. The decision taken by the OFPRA
can then only be reconsidered by appeal before
the National Court for Asylum (CNDA )
```
**1. The OFPRA file**

```
The OFPRA decision depends on your file
and interview. Carefully read the next pages
to fill in your file and prepare your interview.
```
```
Your story must convince the OFPRA you really
are in danger in your country and you can’t
return for fear of persecution, torture, or death.
```
```
We therefore highly recommend you get help
from a specialised organisation or a lawyer to
write your story.
```
```
ADVICE: Keep copies of all of your documents.
Take photos of all of your documents with your
phone and contact organisations to photocopy
the whole file.
```
```
You must send the OFPRA file to the OFPRA
within 21 days!
```
**How to fill in the OFPRA file?**

**1.** It must be written in **French
2.** You (the asylum seeker) must **sign** the file
**3.** It should include the following documents:
- **Two official identity photos**
- **A copy** of your certificate of asylum
    application **(récépissé)**
- **Your ID card or passport (original)** i
    f you have one or any other state documents
    if you have them.
**4.** Fill in your **personal information** as well as
your family’s information (name, birthdate and
place of birth...)
**5.** Indicate the **language** you wish to use for
the interview (see page 44),
**6.** Write **your story in French,** explaining all of
the reasons you left your country to ask for
asylum in France.

```
Your story is the first way to let the OFPRA
know about your fears in detail, so give precise
and coherent information. It must include the
names of people and places as well as specific
dates.
```
```
Do not hesitate to add material evidence
(photos, ID...) to back up your story and testify
to the persecution you went through.
```
```
We highly advise you not to add fake
elements or to pay non-professional people
to translate your story. This could be very
harmful for your asylum application.
Specialized organizations can help you write
your statement in French for free.
```
```
If you have made any errors in your story, you
can ask to correct them during the interview.
```
```
If you need help with
your OFPRA file:
```
```
You can ask the SPADA* to help you fill in the
document and write in French. (* The SPADA is
the organisation that can give you a postal
address if you don’t have a place to live.)
```
```
Other organisations can help you with your
OFPRA file (see page 11)
```
```
Even if you get help from another organization
or a lawyer, carefully read the information given
by this guide regarding the OFPRA file: the
information you give in your file is very
important for your asylum application.
```
```
How and when should you send
your file?
```
```
You must send the file to the OFPRA within
21 days after the date you received it at the
prefecture.
```
```
Send your file to this address:
```
```
OFPRA
201 rue Carnot
94136 Fontenay-sous-Bois
```
```
Send the file from the Post Office as a
registered letter with acknowledgment of
receipt (lettre recommandée avec accusé de
réception) to prove you have sent the file if it
gets lost.
```
```
Or deposit your file in person at the OFPRA (but
you will not immediately be given a receipt
proving that you submitted it («dépôt de
dossier»).
```
```
We advise you to keep copies of all your
documents (file, story, enclosed documents)
and the proof that the OFPRA received your
file.
```
**2. The interview**

```
The interview with the OFPRA is the most
important part of your asylum application.
```
```
You went to the GUDA before May 2nd:
You will receive your notification by mail. Check
for letters at your postal address every week!
The date, hour and details of the interview will
be in the letter.
```
```
The OFPRA can also tell you the date of your
interview by email or text message. If you gave
this information to the administration, be sure
to regularly check your emails and phone.
```
```
You went to the GUDA after May 2nd:
You will receive your notification through your
OFPRA online personal space.
```
```
Check every week for any updates on your file.
The date, hour and details of the interview will
be updated on your online personal space.
```
```
Careful, the OFPRA is now organising
interviews in two different locations in
Fontenay-sous-Bois or Paris. Read your letter
carefully to check the address of your meeting.
```
**Who will be at the interview?**

```
These people have to remain neutral and
confidential:
```
- **A protection officer from the OFPRA** (this
    person is not from the police.)
- **An interpreter if you do not speak French.**
    Double-check they correctly speak your
    language. If you don’t understand the
    interpreter or think that he is not neutral, you
    should tell the protection officer.
- **You can ask for the presence of a lawyer or a**
    **legally authorized representative from an**
    **organisation as a silent witness.** They will be
    authorized to speak at the end of the
    interview.

Juil-Août 2024


```
What happens during
the interview?
```
```
The protection officer will ask questions based
on the information you gave in your OFPRA file.
However, everything you say during the
interview will be more important than what
you wrote in the file for the final decision.
```
**1. The first part of the interview will be about
your civil situation:** the protection officer will
ask you about your identity and your family
situation. It’s important to confirm that the
information is complete and correct, to ensure
the civil information about your family and the
spelling of everyones’ names is correct. Do not
leave any family members out.
**2. The second part will be about your
statement and your fear for your safety.** You
will be able to talk about the events that led
you to leave your country. You will be asked for
further details about the events (dates,
places...). You must give as much detail as
possible in your explanations, and insist on
what happened to you personally.
**3.** At the end of the interview, **you will be
asked to explain what you presently fear if you
return to your country.**

```
An interview usually lasts 1.5 hours, but it can
last anywhere from 45 minutes to several
hours. You have the right to ask to take a break
to get a drink or to go to the toilet.
```
```
How to prepare
for the interview ?
```
```
Your interview is confidential: you can speak
freely.
```
```
It is important to speak as naturally and
spontaneously as possible.
```
```
Don’t learn your story by heart. Try to detail
what you went through by trying to remember
the chronological order of events, dates, places,
people and what role they had everything that
could help the protection officer understand
your story.
```
```
Stick to the facts: if you don’t know something
or if you have forgotten, say so!
```
```
If you don’t understand a question or if you
have any doubts, don’t hesitate to let the
protection officer know.
```
```
If you suffer from memory loss, that you
regularly have nightmares and that reliving
these events is very difficult, let the protection
officer know about your situation. You may be
suffering from post-traumatic stress. You can
get help from a doctor to talk about it and get
a medical certificate to give to the OFPRA (see
page 21)
```
```
How and when will you receive
the decision?
```
```
The OFPRA usually makes a decision within 3
to 4 months, though it may take longer than
expected. If this is the case, the OFPRA will
send you a letter to inform you about the delay.
You might be called for a second interview.
```
```
You went to the GUDA before 2nd May 2022:
```
```
The OFPRA should send you the final decision
by registered mail to your address. It is
therefore very important to check your letters
in your domiciliation centre as often as
possible! If possible, once a week.
```
```
The postman will leave a notification slip («Avis
de passage») at your domiciliation centre. You
should check the Post Office branch address on
the notification slip and you must go to that
address within 15 days with the notification slip
and your asylum seeker certificate, as proof of
identity. It is very important that you collect
your letter at the Post Office within 15 days of
reception of the notification.
```
```
You went to the GUDA after 2nd May 2022:
```
```
You will be notifiied of the decision on your
personal online OFPRA profile. You will not
rceive a letter. You will receive a text for email
to warn you but it is important to check your
online profile weekly.
```
```
When the OFPRA notify you of their
decision on your online profile, you have 15
days to read it. After 15 days, the OFPRA will
assume that you have read it. If you are
rejected, the time to request a lawyer with
legal aid or the time to make an appeal may
have already passed. The time and date you
were notified is very important if you have to
appeal!
```
**3. The decision**

```
The OFPRA will decide if France must protect
you: you can be granted refugee status or a
subsidiary protection; your application can also
be rejected.
```
**1. If the OFPRA grants you refugee status
(«statut de réfugié»):** Go to the prefecture with
the approval letter to get a renewable
residency permit valid for 10 years.
**2. If the OFPRA grants you the subsidiary
protection («protection subsidiaire»):** Go to
the prefecture to get a residency permit valid
for 4 years and then a renewable residency
permit valid for 10 years. You can appeal this
decision (see next pages, same process).
Appealing the decision won’t make you lose the
subsidiary protection.

```
If you have been granted refugee status or
subsidiary protection read page 60 for the
next steps.
```
**3. If the OFPRA rejects your application:** You
can appeal the decision before the National
Court for Asylum (CNDA) (see page 54).

```
If you have been put into a Fast-Track
procedure, you might lose your right to stay
once the OFPRA has rejected your application.
```
```
You might be sent back to your country, even
during the CNDA appeal. In that case, go
straight to a free legal aid office for advice (see
page 11)

**Juil-Août 2024**


MAKING AN APPEAL

TO THE CNDA

```
What is the CNDA?
```
```
Cour Nationale du Droit d’Asile:
```
```
The National Court for Asylum is an
administrative jurisdiction. It’s Judges review
any appeal you can make against OFPRA’s
decision to reject your asylum application. They
closely examine the arguments presented by
both parties (the OFPRA and the asylum
seeker), and then make their decision. The
CNDA can cancel the OFPRA’s decision and
grant the asylum seeker refugee status or
subsidiary protection.
```
```
They can also reject the appeal. In this case the
asylum seeker is denied the right to benefit
from asylum in France.
```
```
If the OFPRA has rejected your asylum
application you can appeal that decision via
the CNDA.
```
**How to lodge an appeal**

**with the CNDA?**

```
The appeal must be presented as a letter,
accompanied by enclosed documents if
necessary, and must be written in French. In
this letter, some important elements must be
written:
```
- **Your civil status and personal information**
    (name, date and place of birth, nationality,
    address...)
- **Arguments to refute elements of the**
    **OFPRA’s decision that you want to contest.**
    Clearly explain the reasons why you think
    OFPRA was wrong about your case.

```
The appeal must reach the CNDA within one
month from the date you received the decision
from OFPRA ; this means within one month
from the day you picked up the letter from the
Post-Office, or the date written on the
postman’s non-delivery notice (avis de passage)
in your domiciliation centre.
```
```
Appealing to the CNDA
isn’t that easy.
```
```
We advise you to ask for help from specialized
organisations (see page 11 or from a lawyer
(see page 50).
```
```
You have 3 options:
```
**1.** Ask for a **free lawyer** to help you by applying
for legal aid («aide juridictionnelle»)
**2.** Hire a **private lawyer
3.** Go through the **appeal by yourself**
(highly unrecommended)
    **1. Free lawyer**

```
Be careful, you have very little time to get legal
aid from a free lawyer: you should apply within
15 days of receiving the rejection letter from
OFPRA.
```
```
Since 2018, you only have 15 days to officially
request free legal aid otherwise you will have
to prepare your defense by yourself. This is not
recommended.
```
```
If you applied for legal aid, the lawyer (who will
receive a copy of your letters) will assist you
through all the procedures linked to the appeal.
```
```
Two ways of applying
for a free lawyer:
```
- **Get help from the SPADA or from a**
    **specialized organisation:** Go to the SPADA or
    a legal aid office for help (see page 11)
- **Ask for a free lawyer (legal aid) by yourself:**
    Write a letter with your signature, specifying
    your civil status, your OFPRA file number and
    a copy of the OFPRA’s decision. Send the
    letter as a registered letter with
    acknowledgment of receipt (like the OFPRA
    file) to this address :

```
Cour nationale du droit d’asile
Bureau d’aide juridictionnelle
35 rue Cuvier,
93558 Montreuil Cedex
```
```
Or by fax: 01 48 18 43 11
Or you can drop off your letter at the address
yourself.
```
```
If you find a lawyer in another way, they must
send a letter to the CNDA to let them know
they are in charge of your file.
```
```
If you apply for a free lawyer within 15 days
after receiving your letter of rejection by the
OFPRA, the one-month period for sending the
appeal will be interrupted until you are granted
a lawyer.
```
```
You will receive two letters within 15 days:
```
- The registration of your application
- The acceptance of your application with the
    name and address of your lawyer.

```
Once you’ve received this letter, your lawyer
will have a very short period of time to appeal!
```
```
Your lawyer will need to meet you and listen to
your story to prepare your case against the
OFPRA’s decision.
```
```
Get in contact with your lawyer as soon as
possible! Lawyers are usually very busy but
don’t hesitate to make an appointment. If
you cannot make an appointment with your
lawyer, ask an organisation for help (see
page 11).
```
**2. A private lawyer**

```
You will have to find and pay for this private
lawyer by yourself.
```
```
With the help of your lawyer, you must send
your appeal to the CNDA within one month
after the reception of the OFPRA’s rejection.
```
```
If you cannot make an appointment with the
lawyer you’ve paid for, ask an organisation for
help (see page 11).
```
**3. Appeal without**

**a lawyer**

```
This is not recommended.
```
```
You will be defending your case to the CNDA
without the help of a lawyer.
```
```
If you wish to appeal and defend your case by
yourself, read the previous information to know
the important elements of an appeal.
```
**What happens after you**

**have sent your appeal?**

```
The CNDA processes your file
```
- You should receive your **appeal registration**
    letter from the CNDA (lettre d’enregistrement
    du recours à la CNDA), proving that your
    appeal has been registered.
- You should then receive a **letter scheduling**
    **your public hearing** (lettre de convocation) at
    the CNDA. In French it is called “convocation
    à la CNDA”

```
if your case isn’t considered to have a
good enough defence to contest the OFPRA
decision, the CNDA can reject your appeal
without a thorough review or a hearing.
(It is called “décision de rejet par ordonnance
CNDA”).
```
```
The hearing takes place at the CNDA’s

```
building (National Court of Asylum) in
Montreuil, near Paris. Be careful, there are
two different locations! Read your letter
carefully to check the address of your meeting.
```
```
Hearings are public, so open to anyone to
attend. Note that you can attend someone
else’s hearing to help you prepare for your own
hearing.
```
```
During the hearing, you will sit in front of a
court made up of three people. Your lawyer will
sit on your right hand side, and your interpreter
on your left hand side.
```
```
If your asylum application is processed in a
fast-track procedure, the court will not be
made up of three people but by only one judge.
```
```
On the day of the hearing, you can ask your
lawyer to request a hearing without the
presence of the public.
```
**The hearing runs as follows:**

**1.** The **rapporteur** explains your case,
**2. The judge(s) ask you questions in order to
clarify some points in your story.** This part is
very important. Speak as naturally and
spontaneously as possible, while offering the
details and circomstances asked, as the judge
will be listening to see if you seem truthful and
whether your fears and concerns are
believable. (see page 36 with our advice for the
OFPRA interview)
Your lawyer will not be able to help you during
that part: you know your story much better
than they do!
**3. Finally, your lawyer will speak and defend
your asylum application,** insisting on some
important elements of your story and criticizing
the OFPRA’s decision.

```
You will receive the CNDA’s decision within the
next three weeks by registered letter. The
decision will also be displayed at the CNDA on a
date which will have been specified the day of
the hearing.
```
**What to do once**

**you have received**

**the decision?**

```
You will receive the CNDA’s final decision within
the next three weeks by registered letter to
your address. Check your letters at least once a
week!
```
```
The CNDA can either decide to cancel the
OFPRA decision, granting you refugee status or
subsidiary protection, or can refuse your
asylum application.
```
```
If you have been granted refugee status
or subsidiary protection:
read page 54 for information about how to go
about the next steps.
```
```
If the CNDA refuses to grant you protection:
You have very few possibilities left:
```
- You can **appeal in front of the Board of State**
    **(Conseil d’Etat)** but the conditions are very
    strict and success is very rare. This appeal
    only concerns problems linked to the
    procedure, not the information in your file;
- You can also ask to have your **file re-**
    **examined** but you must have more facts
    added to your situation that haven’t yet been
    studied by the OFPRA and the CNDA during
    your asylum application. (See page 54)

```
If the CNDA has refused to grant you
protection, you will lose your right to stay on
French territory. You risk getting arrested and
being sent back to your country. Go to a free
legal aid office to ask for advice (see page 11
and carefully read page 29 “In case you get
arrested” to be sure to know your rights.
```
**Assisted voluntary**

**return:**

```
If you want to return to your home country, you
can apply to OFII for assisted voluntary return.
For certain countries, reintegration assistance is
offered in your home country.

**Juil-Août 2024**


```
Examples of events that can be considered as
new facts if they have not been mentioned
before to the OFPRA or CNDA:
```
- The **evolution of the political and/or security**
    **situation** in the country if it has an impact on
    your personal situation.
- The **grant of protection status to a relative**
    **whose fears of persecution are related to**
    **your own situation.**

```
New evidence is not a new fact.
```
```
Your reconsideration will not be accepted if the
element that you add only confirms your
previous oral or written statements.
```
```
Examples:
```
- A membership certificate from a political
    party is not new evidence if you had
    previously mentioned your membership to
    this party.
- A newspaper article or a letter from a lawyer
    mentioning facts that had already been
    considered in your previous application will
    only be considered as simple evidence for
    previous facts.

```
A new element does not necessarily have to
be a written document.
It can be an event that you can describe in oral
statements.
In that case, you will have to be very precise
about your statement (dates, places, names...)
to recount the event.
```
### IMPORTANT TO KNOW

```
Even if your fact is considered new, it will not
automatically ensure protection.
Do not add any documents in your file without
explaining how you found them and why you
didn’t present them during your first asylum
application.
It is important to know that even though some
documents contain new facts, applications for
reconsideration are often rejected by OFPRA
and CNDA as they are doubtful about their
authenticity.
```
APPLYING FOR

YOUR CASE TO BE

RECONSIDERED

“RÉEXAMEN”

```
If you hear about new events that make your
country more unsafe for you, you can apply to
the OFPRA for reconsideration of your asylum
application. There are no specific time limits to
apply for reconsideration.
```
```
The only condition is to have new facts
confirming the threats against you if you
return to your country.
```
```
Be sure to understand what defines
a new fact.
```
```
If you apply for reconsideration with a file that
does not meet the criteria described here, your
application will be rejected without an
interview.
```
```
What is a new fact?
```
```
It is an event indicating that you may still fear
persecution or serious threats, meaning those
threats are still going on. A fact is new if it
occurred after the final rejection of your
previous asylum application.
```
```
Therefore, a fact is new if it happened:
```
- After the **date of the decision of the National**
    **Court of Asylum (CNDA)**
- **After the date of the OFPRA’s decision** (if you
    did not appeal to the CNDA)
- If the event occurred before the decision of
    rejection from the OFPRA or the CNDA, the
    fact could be considered new **if you can**
    **prove that you did not know about it at the**
    **time of the rejection decision,** or if you give
    reasons for not being able to talk about the
    specific event during you first application.

**How to apply for your**

**case to be reconsidered?**

```
Just as for your first asylum application, the
application for reconsideration is handled by
the OFPRA and the CNDA.
```
```
First of all, you must go to the SPADA to make
an appointment with the prefecture to hand in
your application for reconsideration.
```
```
You should go to the SPADA in the same region
of the prefecture where you made your first
application.
```
```
In Paris and Île-de-France, you can call the OFII
number 01 42 500 900 (not free) and specify
you want to apply for reconsideration.
```
```
At the prefecture you should be given an
attestation for your asylum application and an
application form (pink). Your application will
automatically be processed in a fast-track
procedure. The time it takes to examine the
application will be very short.
```
```
We recommend you rewrite your story
with the new facts and ask for advice from a
specialized organisation (see page 11) before
going to the prefecture. You only have 8 days
to send your file to the OFPRA.
```
```
If your application for reconsideration is
declared invalid by OFPRA, you can appeal to
the CNDA to contest this decision.
```
```
If the application is declared valid but, after the
re-examination, is rejected by the OFPRA, you
can also appeal to the CNDA (see page 53)

IF YOU HAVE

BEEN GRANTED

PROTECTION

```
When your asylum claim is successful, the
OFPRA or CNDA grants you ‘international
protection’: refugee status, subsidiary
protection status or stateless person status.
```
```
This means that:
```
- You are **protected** by the French State,
- You have the **right to remain in France,**
- You will be **able to access a number of rights**
    **that are granted to French people.**

```
As soon as you receive the decision, you
must go to the ANEF (Digital Administration for
Foreigners in France) website to get a
certificate (récépissé) https://administration-
etrangers-en-france.interieur.gouv.fr/
particuliers/#/ then select the « Je demande ou
renouvelle un titre de séjour » section. To make
an account on the ANEF website, you need your
foreign national number and the start and
expiry dates of your asylum seeker’s receipt
(récépissé). The récépissé is a provisional
document which certifies the “recognition of
international protection” (reconnaissance de
protection internationale) granted you and
enables you to start the next steps of your
procedure while you wait for your residence
card.
```
**What are your rights?**

```
The OFPRA will give you official identity
documents (“documents d’état civil”) in your
name recognized by French administration
(birth certificate, wedding certificate...). You will
not be allowed to contact your own country’s
administration, otherwise you risk losing state
protection.
```
```
Right to remain: after receiving your civil
status documents from OFPRA,
```
- Refugees get a residency card valid for 10
    years
- Beneficiaries of subsidiary protection get a
    renewable residency card with an initial
    validity of 4 years.
- You can ask for **travel documents (“titres de**
    **voyage”)** which allow you to travel to any
    country except your home country. Request
    these documents at the Prefecture, online or
    by postal mail. You will need 2 identity
    photos, your residency permit, proof of
    residency and your OFPRA international
    protection attestation. The travel documents
    cost 45€.
- As soon as you receive the decision from the
    OFPRA or the CNDA, you can get full citizen
    rights to benefit from social and **family**
    **benefits (RSA, social housing application ...)**
- **You are allowed to work in France.** For more
    information see page 38.
- **You can go back to University.** See page 37.
- **You can change your driver’s licence to a**
    **French driver’s licence.** Procedures for
    exchanging a foreign driver’s licence can now
    only be done online on the ANTS website:
    https://permisdeconduire.ants.gouv.fr

```
WARNING: You can only exchange your
driver’s permit for one year after you
received your residency permit. The driver’s
licence exchange is not possible for people
coming from Afghanistan, Eritrea, Nigeria,
Pakistan, Senegal, Somalia and Syria (see the
complete list on the Public Service website:
https://www.service-public.fr/simulateur/
calcul/PermisEtrangerPermisFrancais)
```
- You can **apply for French citizenship** in the
    closest Prefecture to where you live.
    The refugee status gives you the right to ask
    for French citizenship as soon as you receive
    refugee status.
    With subsidiary protection status you must
    prove you have lived in France for 5 years.

**Family reunification**

**(“réunification**

**familiale”)**

```
Your family can join you
in France:
```
- This can be your **husband, wife or partner**
    Beware: If the marriage was conducted
after your asylum application, then you will
go through a different and more difficult
procedure called “regroupement familial”
in French.
- Your **children** (under 20 years old) and your
    partner’s children (under 18 years old)

```
If you are under 18 years old, you can ask
for your parents and, if they are under 18
years old, your brothers and sisters.
```
```
How to have your family
join you?
```
**1. Your family must ask for a long-stay visa
at their closest French consulate with these
documents:** A filled-in application form, your
OFPRA international protection attestation, a
copy of your birth or wedding certificate 4
identity pictures per member of your family,
and the passports of each family member.
The application costs €99
**2. The Office for Refugees’ Families (Bureau
des familles de réfugiés)** should contact you to
get: a copy of your residence card or of your
**récépissé** , a filled-out form concerning your
family, your proof of residence and other
documents proving your family ties.
**3. The procedure can take up to 8 months.**
- If your family’s visa application is approved,
    they have 3 months to arrive in France.
- If your family’s visa application is refused
    or if they don’t receive any answer from
    the consulate, you have 2 months to appeal.

**How to get help?**

```
These first steps may seem complicated, don’t
forget that you can get help from various
specialist organisations:
```
- **The SPADA reception centre or housing**
    **centre** you were living in during the
    procedure. They can help you seek full citizen
    rights and find new accommodation.
- **The communal social action centre (centre**
    **communal d’action sociale, or CCAS)** of the
    town or region you live in. Make an
    appointment with a social worker, who
    should assist you with your financial and
    employment procedure as well as your
    application for social housing.
- **You can also go to the legal help centres**
    specialising in helping refugees (see page 11)

RESIDENCE

PERMITS

```
A residence permit and receiving refugee
status do not have the same purpose. When
applying for asylum, you will be asked about
the persecutions that you face in your home
country, whereas to obtain a residence permit,
it is your situation in France that matters.
```
```
In many cases, you will need documented proof
on how long you have been staying in France,
how well you speak the language, your ties to
French citizens or foreigners who have a
residence permit.
```
```
You will therefore need to put together
documents proving that you have been staying
in France.
```
```
For further help and information on those
documents, see page 5
```
```
Residence permits are mostly applied for at
the French consulate of your home country.
```
```
There you will apply for a long-stay visa (visa D)
that enables you to obtain a residence permit
(for example: for a family reunification, to study
in France, to work in France). The long-stay visa
differs from the tourist visa, which only lasts 3
months (visa C).
```
```
However, if you are already in France, you can
obtain the right to stay on French territory by
applying for specific residency permits. This is
called “regularisation”.
```
```
It is possible to apply
for a residency permit:
```
- **If you are in an “irregular situation,”** meaning
    if you do not have papers that give you the
    right to stay in France.
- **If you are seeking asylum.** When you file your
    asylum application at the prefectures, you will
    be asked if you also want to apply for a
    residency permit. **You will need to give a**
    **response within two months, except for the**
    **‘residency permit for health reasons’ for**
    **which you have 3 months.** Your application
    for a residency permit will only be processed
    once you have received an answer on your
    asylum application. You will not be able to
    apply for a new residency permit if your
    asylum application is rejected, except in
    certain specific cases.

```
There are many conditions to obtaining a
residency permit and applying for one is a
complicated and risky procedure. Each
application is specific to itself and the
chances of obtaining a residency permit
depends on your individual situation.
Keep in mind that if your application is
rejected, you are always at risk of expulsion.
For more information on what to do if you
are arrested, see page 29.
```
```
It is therefore important to get advice from
lawyers before applying for a residency permit.
```
```
Go to a legal help centre to evaluate your
specific situation and to fill in your application
(see page 11)
```
```
Some residency permits are more certain than
others. It is important to note the difference
between “Residence permits as fundamental
rights” and “Discretionary residence permits”.
```
```
The criteria to obtain a “residence permit as
fundamental rights” are included in the law. If
you meet these criteria, your residence permit
should be delivered by the prefectures. If your
application is rejected, a lawyer can be
contacted in order to “appeal” the decision.
Most “private and family life” residencey
permits are fundamental rights (parent of a
French child, married to a French citizen,
significant private and family ties). This is also
the case for the “residence permit for health
reasons” when serious illnesses cannot be
treated in the home country. Warning: there
are many conditions to obtain it, but they can
be unclear.
```
```
“Discretionary” residence permits are
riskier and more difficult to obtain because,
as indicated in the name, they are subject to
the discretionary assessment of the prefect,
allowing them to make the final decision. This
means that even if you meet the criteria for a
residence permit, the prefect can still reject
your application. For instance, the work permit
is discretionary.
```
```
Please note that to meet all the conditions
(even for “residence permits as fundamental
rights”) does not mean you will automatically
be approved for a residency permit. Keep in
mind that if your application is rejected, you
are always at risk of expulsion. Don’t start the
procedure by yourself. Ask for help from an
organization that specializes in residence
permits (see page 11)
